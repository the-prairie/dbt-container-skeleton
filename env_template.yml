# This is a template to define default environment variables that will be set when you
# spin up a dbt-shell container.
# This file should be committed to version control and therefore DO NOT PUT secrets in this file.
# Generally, this file should not be edited by a user.  User values are configured via `inv config`.

  Set the default environment variables that will be defined when you spin
  up a dbt-shell container.  Press enter to accept the existing value.

  Default values are set here, but any environment variables defined on the host
  when a dbt-shell is started will override the defaults defined here.

variables:
  PROJECT_ID:
    description: Name of the project on GCP
    default: my.gcp.project.id


  DTSPEC_LOG_LEVEL:
    description: Default log level for running dtspec tests
    default: INFO
    user: False
